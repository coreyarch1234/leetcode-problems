# Given a binary tree, determine if it’s a binary search tree or not.

# Rotate a linked list to the right by k places. (The last k elements move to the front.)

# Find the longest consecutive sequence of increasing numbers in an array.

# Given a list of numbers and a number K, determine if any three numbers sum up to K.

# Implement a queue with 2 stacks. Your queue should have enqueue and dequeue methods and should be “first in first out.” You already have a stack implementation that gives O(1) time push and pop methods. Optimize for the total time cost of m function calls on your queue, which can be any mix of enqueue and dequeue calls.

# Find the second largest element in a binary search tree.

# Given a collection of distinct numbers, return all possible permutations. For example, [1,2,3] have the following permutations:[
#   [1,2,3],
#   [1,3,2],
#   [2,1,3],
#   [2,3,1],
#   [3,1,2],
#   [3,2,1]
# ]

# Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once. For example, Given 1->1->2, return 1->2. Given 1->1->2->3->3, return 1->2->3.

# Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.
